Welcome to the MyTVBoxIsNutz 

There is a new update available! Click on Settings<Add-ons<Install from ZIP<Nutz and click 
on the only option available. Once enable to go SETTINGS<Add-ons<My Add-ons<Programs and run the Nutz Wizard.

A lot of changes available. New movie and TV source! Pick your movie and select auto-play.
Live kids TV now under Live TV. New Sports sources and shortcuts! Pick the yellow option under
Live TV and select BT2 to watch PPV UFC fights. If that doesn't work for you, MAMAHD under Pheonix Sports
also works well.  HD Sources for UFC in next update!  Going to try to work on getting at least 1
game system working in the next few weeks. Controller sold seperately.

DO NOT STOP A VIDEO, JUST PAUSE IT!! 
For some reason, stopping causes Kodi to crash. Just pause and no problems.
PLEASE BE PATIENT WITH THE BOX!
Sometimes you just have to wait a little bit for it to work.

Any questions, requests or problems? Email mytvboxisnutz@gmail.com
